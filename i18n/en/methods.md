# Methods and analysis

Runestaves are medieval and early modern calendars carved in wood. This project uses digital methods to analyze these artifacts and understand how calendar knowledge spread and varied across time and geography.

## Data collection and transcription

All data has been transcribed from physical runestaves in museum collections. The transcription includes:

- Date annotations (day by day through the year)
- Feast days and saint names
- Symbols and markings
- Physical properties (material, shape, size)

## Normalization

To enable comparisons between runestaves, feast names are normalized to canonical forms. This makes it possible to identify the same feast even when it is spelled or written in different ways.

## Phylogenetic analysis

We use methods from phylogenetic analysis to investigate similarities and differences between runestaves. The analysis is based on presence or absence of normalized feasts.
