Runestaves (also called primstaves) are wooden calendars that were in use from the Middle Ages until the 19th century. They were used to keep track of feast days, markets, and other important dates.

Each day of the year is marked with runes, symbols and sometimes text. The symbols can represent everything from religious feasts to agricultural activities.

This digital project collects data from hundreds of preserved runestaves in Swedish museum collections and makes them available for research and the public.
